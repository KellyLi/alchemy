			<h1>About Alchemy</h1>
			<div class='red_divider'></div>
			<p>Alchemy, previously Neverfrost, was founded in May 2013 by a group of Nanotechnology Engineering graduates from the University of Waterloo. The company began with an intent to commercialize an innovation in sprayable anti-frost coatings, but soon thereafter expanded its technological infrastructure to include the current ExoShield technologies.</p>
			<p>At Alchemy, our ambition and vision is quite simple: to build a nanotechnology company for the 21st century. We believe that with the right platform technologies, a culture that encourages creative risk taking, and a modern approach towards creating and commercializing technology, we can commercialize nanotechnology far more rapidly than it is done today.</p>
